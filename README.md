## Slides

The presentation slides can be found in the root of the project: [Quality stages of Python development.pdf](<Quality stages of Python development.pdf>)

## Branches

This repo contains different branches to apply the concepts of the presentation step by step:

- `raw_1`: represents the initial code, without applying any linter.
- `auto_2`: just with the configuration of the IDE (VSCode) and the help of extensions, the code gets formatted.
- `types_3`: adds type hint and a couple of tests.
- `linter_4`: applies clean code, add more tests, fix some bugs.

Each branch has its `README.md` with more details about what is going on there and the tools used.
